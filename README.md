## Hello! (Ð—Ð´Ñ€Ð°Ð²Ð¾!) ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ivan VlatkoviÄ‡. I am a full stack developer from Novi Sad, Serbia (GMT+1), and I have been creating content on the web since ~2009.

My preferred web stack is Node.js for the backend and Next.js (React) for the frontend, but I'm very interested in exploring Go for microservice development and Svelte.js for the frontend.

Occasionally I write articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ivandotv) and I'm also a guest author on the [Logrocket blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/ivanvlatkovic/).

Don't be shy, reach out, I'm always looking to connect with interesting people, and I'm open to new opportunities.
